# Segmentation of arbitrary features in very high resolution remote sensing imagery

This is the code repository for my M.Sc. thesis at Imperial College London,
"[Segmentation of arbitrary features in very high resolution remote sensing imagery](TODO)".

The initial code version at time of publication on arXiv is tagged `v1.0`. The codebase may evolve in the future with
new features, bugfixes, and so on.

## Abstract

Very high resolution (VHR) mapping through remote sensing (RS) imagery presents a new opportunity to inform
decision-making and sustainable environmental practices in countless domains. Efficient processing of large scale VHR
data requires automated tools applicable to numerous geographic regions and features. Contemporary RS studies address
this challenge by employing deep learning (DL) models. However, solutions are designed for specific datasets or
features, which prevents their applicability across contexts.

The present research tackles this challenge by introducing EcoMapper, a scalable solution to segment arbitrary features
in VHR RS imagery. EcoMapper fully automates processing of geospatial data, DL model training, and inference. Models
trained with EcoMapper successfully segmented two distinct features in a real-world UAV dataset, achieving scores
competitive with prior studies which employed context-specific models.

To evaluate EcoMapper, many additional models were trained on permutations of principal field survey characteristics:
feature size, ground sampling distance (GSD), and spatial extent. A relationship was discovered allowing derivation of
optimal GSD from feature size, termed Cording index (CI). A comprehensive methodology for field surveys was developed to
ensure DL methods can be applied effectively to collected data.

## Installation

<details>

<summary>Click to expand</summary>

First, check if conda is already installed by running:

```shell
conda --version
# Should print: conda <some version>
```

If an error is reported, install `miniconda`
from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html or use `miniforge`, which provides `mamba` as a
faster alternative:
https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

Next, update conda:

```shell
conda update -n base -c conda-forge conda -y
```

Create an environment and activate it. Be sure to use Python __3.10__ as shown.

```shell
conda create -n ecomapper python=3.10 GDAL=3.7.2 -y
conda activate ecomapper
```

Update pip and install the project dependencies:

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install MMCV (be sure to use `mim` instead of `pip`!)

```shell
mim install "mmcv==2.0.0"
```

Install MMSegmentation and MMDetection

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation@30a3f94f3e2916e27fa38c67cc3b8c69c1893fe8
pip install git+https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection@ecac3a77becc63f23d9f6980b2a36f86acd00a8a
```

</details>

## Usage

Please refer to [the quickstart guide](QUICKSTART.md).

## Development

### Generating documentation

Build modules (only if any modules were changed):

```shell
sphinx-apidoc -M -f -o docs/ ./ecomapper
```

Generate documentation:

```shell
python -m sphinx -b html docs/ docs/_build/
```

After building, you can open the HTML documentation from `docs/_build/index.html`.

### Running tests

Please note that some tests in `tests/functional` are computationally expensive
and may take longer to complete on CPU-only systems. Using a dedicated GPU is recommended.

To run tests:
```shell
pytest
```

### Linting with flake8

```shell
python -m flake8
```

### Type checking with Pytype

```shell
python -m pytype
```

### Regenerating `requirements.txt`

```shell
uv pip compile --universal --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in
```

Afterwards, sync the requirements:

```shell
uv pip sync requirements.txt

mim install "mmcv==2.0.0"
pip install git+https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation@30a3f94f3e2916e27fa38c67cc3b8c69c1893fe8
pip install git+https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection@ecac3a77becc63f23d9f6980b2a36f86acd00a8a
pip install gdal==3.7.2
```
